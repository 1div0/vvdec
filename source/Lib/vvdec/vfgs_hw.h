/* This file is based on VFGS, available on
 * https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/VersatileFilmGrain
 *
 * VFGS implements film grain synthesis as a hardware model: it simulates the
 * output of a cost-effective hardware implementation in a video display
 * pipeline. Also, the C code is split into "fw" (firmware) and "hw" (hardware)
 * parts, and as self-explanatory as possible. See VFGS github repository for
 * more details.
 *
 * The VFGS github repository also contains other tools to experiment with film
 * grain synthesis (e.g. a graphical display and tuning tool for FGC SEI
 * message).
